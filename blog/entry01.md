This freedom project was more able to do anything you really wanted to do. If you were really interested in a topic, game or app you have the freedom to make that thing. At first, I didn't know what to make. However, throughout the years in SEP, I found it a bit difficult on some topics. I wanted to create a learning website (kind of like deltamath) but on SEP by using javascript. When Mr. Mueller told us to share the idea of the freedom project, he gave me a suggestion that it was too much for me. So, I did a little brainstorming and wanted to do a certain topic. I asked Mr. Mueller if it would be okay to create a lesson and a few questions for future kids. He confirmed and encouraged creativity, he suggested I do the tool jest. When it was time to tinker with our tools. I was trying really hard towards the end to tinker with my tool. I found that Jest seemed outdated because I installed the website and tried to do the "Getting Started" section. However, it kept showing me errors, I tried watching a how-to-get-set-up video on Jest. It still gave me an error. I tried rereading the text, rewatching, and redownloading it but it always showed me an error. So I decided to go switch my current main idea into my backup plan. 
    
    My backup plan was to create a point-of-view type game where you could dodge, attack, and interact with a non-player character by using the tool A-frame. I've always wanted to try out A-frame in SEP 10, but now I have gotten an opportunity to choose that tool. At first, I tinkered with Aframe by putting the "Getting Started" code into my JsBin. I started to read the section on "JavaScript, Events, DOM APIs". 
In the beginning, I put the coding for Javascript on Jsbin and found a small error.
```js
    <a-scene log="Hello, Scene!">
  <a-box log="Hello, Box!"></a-box>
</a-scene>
<script src="https://aframe.io/releases/1.4.0/aframe.min.js"></script>
```
    In the document, it also writes to put `<script>` first instead of `<a-scene>`. 
Throughout reading carefully, I found that A-frame seems a lot more interactive and reminds me a lot about my previous tool. A-frame provides examples and explanations that are really clear to understand and interact with. So I would stick with the tool of A-frame and make a shooter game and dodging obstacles with my assigned partner Shubata. 
    This is the first step in the Engineering Design Process where I try to define a problem and do background knowledge on it. My problem, in the beginning, was my lack of creativity, once I thought of an idea I tried to find the best tool that could help me make things easier on the learning website. I asked Mr. Mueller what to do next and he recommended a tool to tinker with. Then after some confusion in the beginning I went back to my backup and used some background knowledge on A-frame that I will be using from now on. During this blog, I've learned the skills of "How to read" and "Creativity". Since reading is very important to understand, tinker, and code. I took some time to understand what was wrong with my coding until I started to read on the document to know what was wrong with my coding. I've also used the skill of "creativity" to find out what I really wanted to make for a whole year. I kept asking myself questions like "What am I really passionate about?" and "Am I really able to make it?" I needed to find something more moderate for me to do and not too difficult.
