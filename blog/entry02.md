When learning my tool in A-frame, there are a lot of new concepts in A-frame for HTML and Javascript. My partner and I would normally talk with each other about what we plan to learn for the week and what we can use for our freedom project. My partner, Shubata, has more experience in A-frame than I do, so I needed to understand some of the context and basic HTML first to understand what to do next. While tinkering with A-frame I liked how it was a lot more realistic and interactive for some of the examples in the videos and the article. 
I began to learn about the basics of A-frame like `<a-entity>`
