# SEP11 Freedom Project
by **Shelly Weng**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is a year-long project all about making something using JavaScript along with a third-party JS tool.

For my project, I chose to independently study **Aframe** in order to help me make my project called **The Quiet City**.

* Sometimes we created some time to meet and discuss what we made but there were some times when we didn't meet because it was a busy week for one another
* Had some difficulties coding because I didn't fully understand how I would be able to code it
* Difficulties learning my tool a-frame because the tutorials were a bit outdated
