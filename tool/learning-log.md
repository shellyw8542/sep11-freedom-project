10/28/2023:
* I went the the [Getting Started](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) to find the setup and a [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgnxcUQ5vho&ab_channel=WebDevSimplified) Of the setup in jest. (benefits of jests)
* I tried to use the code that was provided in the website, however, I didn't understand what npm or yarn meant
* Reading if you need to have Jest [installed](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69559370/jest-without-npm-or-yarn) in order to test the coding out 
* When trying out the coding on [https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started] for yarn in [JS Bin](https://jsbin.com/nibezeyeho/edit?js,console) it kept giving me errors or `https://jsbin.com/nibezeyeho/edit?js,console` meaning that I would have to download it.
* As for now, I will watch videos about Jest to see if it would fit into my coding style.
