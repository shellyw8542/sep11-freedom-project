10/28/2023:
* I went the the [Getting Started](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) to find the setup and a [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgnxcUQ5vho&ab_channel=WebDevSimplified) Of the setup in jest. (benefits of jests)
* I tried to use the code that was provided on the website, however, I didn't understand what npm or yarn meant
* Reading if you need to have Jest [installed](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69559370/jest-without-npm-or-yarn) in order to test the coding out 
* When trying out the coding on [https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started] for yarn in [JS Bin](https://jsbin.com/nibezeyeho/edit?js,console) it kept giving me errors or `https://jsbin.com/nibezeyeho/edit?js,console` meaning that I would have to download it.
* As for now, I will watch videos about Jest to see if it would fit into my coding style.

10/29/2023:
* Got to download Jestjs on my ide sandbox.
11/5/2023:
* Gotten to create a platform for jest runs
* Getting started had a test that you will need to "run npm" with
* It kept showing me an error on the JSON
* Decide to look at the backup tool (Aframe)
* Getting started for A-frame was pretty simple and jsbin friendly.
* Aframe needs to have <script> before the <a-scene>

11/13/2023:
* Discussed with Shubata about what do to for the freedom project
* Plan on using the [360](https://aframe.io/examples/showcase/sky/)
* Shubata gave me a [video]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFTSLHd7xgY)
* Another link from the demo in [A-Frame](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/examples/test/video/index.html)
* Considering both the video and the link they both have `video id (and/or) src` <-- this is a lot like the HTML img id (which gives the img variable a name) and src is the link or file for the video)
* `<videosphere src>` <-- for the 360 videos and depending on the video's length and width has a rotation [00, 00, 00]
* Loops
* Autoplay loop can be true or false (true means keep playing) (false stop playing)
* Came across an error with Jsbin when tinkering with the demo with autoplay false.
* When testing loops (with A-frame) right-click and turn off the loop.
* Play and Pause can be used by javascript `play-pause` in HTML
